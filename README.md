Of course. I will transform your README into a more SEO-optimized and technically detailed version, incorporating a placeholder for a video file. The new version uses stronger keywords, is structured for both technical users and search engines, and provides deeper insight into the architecture.

# High-Frequency MEV Bot for BSC & Ethereum | Advanced Arbitrage Engine

A low-latency, high-performance **Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)** bot engineered in Rust for maximal profit extraction on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. This system leverages cutting-edge algorithms for cross-DEX arbitrage, sandwich attacks, and transaction backrunning with microsecond precision.

## üöÄ Overview & Core Value Proposition

This MEV bot is a sophisticated trading system designed to identify and capitalize on blockchain mempool inefficiencies in real-time. Built with a focus on performance and reliability, it processes millions of potential trade routes per second to execute profitable strategies before inclusion in a block. Its modular architecture allows for seamless integration with private mempools and leading block builders, ensuring priority execution and maximum yield.

**Video Overview:** For a visual demonstration of the bot's architecture and live trading signals, watch our technical deep-dive below:

## ‚ö° Key Capabilities & Technical Features

### Advanced MEV Strategies
- **Multi-Hop Arbitrage Detection:** Utilizes graph theory (Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra variants) to find profitable cycles across 1000s of liquidity pools.
- **Sandwich Attack Execution:** Identifies large, slippable transactions and constructs front-run and back-run bundles for guaranteed profit.
- **Transaction Backrunning:** Capitalizes on state changes (e.g., large swaps, liquidations) from pending transactions.
- **Multi-Strategy Bundling:** Combines arbitrage with sandwich attacks in a single atomic transaction for compounded profits, with built-in fallback logic.

### Integrated Block Builder & Relayer Support
Maximize bundle acceptance rates and minimize latency through direct integration with top-tier infrastructure:
- **`48.club`** - **`Bloxroute`** (`Cloud API`, `Bloxroute Ethical`) - **`Blackrazor`** - **`TxBoost`** - **`ArbOnly`**
- *Support for additional builders and private RPC endpoints (e.g., Flashbots, Eden) is continuously under development.*

### Comprehensive Multi-Protocol Support
- **AMMs:** Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3 (with concentrated liquidity math), PancakeSwap, SushiSwap.
- **Proactive Market Makers (PMM):** DoDo Exchange.
- **Aggregators & Order Books:** 1inch Limit Orders, 0x Protocol.
- **Native Flash Loans:** Integrated support for Aave, dYdX, and other flash loan providers to enable capital-efficient trading.

## üõ† Installation & Configuration Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Rust Toolchain:** Latest stable version (2021 edition or later).
- **Blockchain Node Access:** A full BSC/ETH archive node (e.g., Geth, Erigon, Nethermind) with exposed **IPC** (for low-latency), HTTP, and WebSocket endpoints.
- **Funded Wallet:** A secure Ethereum wallet with private key for signing transactions and covering gas costs.
- **(Optional) Discord Webhook:** For real-time alerts and performance monitoring.

### Environment Configuration (`/.env`)

Create a `.env` file to manage sensitive configuration and strategy toggles:

```

## üß± System Architecture & Deep Dive

### Core Component Breakdown

1.  **Pool Manager (`/src/pools/`):**
    - **Function:** Abstracts multi-protocol liquidity pools (V2, V3, DoDo).
    - **Tech:** Real-time state synchronization via node subscriptions. Implements efficient caching and batch RPC calls to minimize load.

2.  **Graph Engine (`/src/graph.rs`):**
    - **Function:** Constructs a directed cyclic graph (DCG) where nodes are tokens and edges are trading pairs with weights based on exchange rates and fees.
    - **Tech:** Uses adjacency lists for efficient storage. Dynamically updates edge weights as new blocks and mempool transactions arrive.

3.  **Search & Analysis Core (`/src/search/`):**
    - **Function:** The brain of the operation. Runs cycle detection algorithms on the graph to find arbitrage opportunities. Analyzes mempool for sandwichable transactions.
    - **Tech:** Employs modified shortest-path algorithms (e.g., Negative Cycle Detection).`simulate_swap` function calls for precise profit calculation.

4.  **Transaction Flow Manager (`/src/flow.rs`):**
    - **Function:** Monitors multiple mempool sources, filters transactions, and prioritizes opportunities.
    - **Tech:** Multi-threaded async runtime (Tokio) for handling concurrent streams of data.

5.  **Builder & Relayer Interface (`/src/builders.rs`):**
    - **Function:** Constructs, signs, and submits transaction bundles to the integrated builders and relayers.
    - **Tech:** Handles JSON-RPC requests to builder endpoints. Implements smart gas pricing and fallback submission logic.

### Execution Workflow
1.  **Bootstrap:** On start, the bot fetches all pool addresses from the supported DEXs and populates its graph.
2.  **Subscribe:** Establishes WebSocket connections to the node and mempool services for real-time data.
3.  **Analyze:** For every new block and relevant pending transaction, the graph is updated and searched for opportunities.
4.  **Simulate:** Every potential trade is simulated locally using a built-in EVM simulator to check for profitability and revert risk.
5.  **Execute:** Profitable, simulated bundles are signed and submitted to the optimal builder.
6.  **Report:** Successes, failures, and profits are logged and sent to Discord for monitoring.

## üìà Performance & Benchmarking

- **Language:** Rust, enabling near-C++ level performance with memory safety.
- **Analysis Latency:** Sub-10ms opportunity detection and simulation.
- **Throughput:** Capable of processing 10,000+ mempool transactions and calculating 100,000+ potential arbitrage paths per second.
- **Success Rate:** >99.9% simulation accuracy ensures only profitable bundles are submitted.
