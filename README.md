**Paperless-AI** is an AI-powered extension for [Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) that brings automatic document classification, smart tagging, and semantic search using OpenAI-compatible APIs and Ollama.

It enables **fully automated document workflows**, **contextual chat**, and **powerful customization** — all via an intuitive web interface.

> 💡 Just ask:  
> “When did I sign my rental agreement?”  
> “What was the amount of the last electricity bill?”  
> “Which documents mention my health insurance?”  

Powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, you can now search semantically across your full archive and get precise, natural language answers.
